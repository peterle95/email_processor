- A Google Cloud Platform account
- A Groq API account

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-workflow-automation.git
cd email-workflow-automation

2. Create a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv langchain_env
source langchain_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use langchain_env\Scripts\activate
Copy
3. Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up Google Cloud Platform:
- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Create a new project
- Enable the Gmail API for your project
- Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (select Desktop app as the application type)
- Download the client configuration and save it as `client_secret.json` in the project directory

5. Set up Groq API:
- Sign up for a Groq account at [https://www.groq.com/](https://www.groq.com/)
- Obtain your API key

6. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
CLIENT_SECRET_FILE_1=/path/to/your/client_secret_1.json
CLIENT_SECRET_FILE_2=/path/to/your/client_secret_2.json
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

## Usage

1. Run the script:
python email_processor.py

2. The first time you run the script, it will prompt you to authorize the application. Follow the URL provided and enter the authorization code.

3. The script will process unread emails from your inbox, categorize them, and generate responses for important emails.

4. For each email that requires a response, you'll be prompted to review and approve sending the response.

## Customization

- Adjust the `SCOPES` in `email_processor.py` if you need different Gmail API permissions.
- Modify the `basic_categorization` function to customize email categorization.
- Update the `generate_response` function to change how AI-generated responses are created.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter OAuth errors, ensure your Google Cloud project is properly configured and the client secret file is correct.
- For Groq API issues, verify your API key and check Groq's service status.
- If emails are not being fetched correctly, check your Gmail account settings and ensure the script has the necessary permissions.
